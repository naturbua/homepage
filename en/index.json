Using the headset as an example, I focused on measures that make the product itself more robust and accessible for repairs and upgrades. The aesthetic design should consistently reflect authenticity, honesty, and functionality to avoid the constant changes in fashion. Separable, honest, single-type. The design focussed on simple assembly, accessibility and separability of the components. In order to achieve this without conflict, I decided to incorporate a technically more complex but rational solution at the points marked in red. The sliding contact (next picture) offers an elegant interface that ensures easy separability and completely eliminates the risk of cable breaks at the yoke. Separable sliding contact, 6-pin, approx. 20° inclinable Instead of running a often delicate cable through the yoke as it is common for this product segment, a separable sliding contact was introduced at the hinge points. Although this is a technically more complex solution in terms of production, the advantage of simple assembly and disassembly in a durable product outweighs this. Any cost increases can be reduced by using the sliding contact multiple times in similar product series. This solution is used on both joints of the yoke, the illustrations only show one position. In pursuit of timelessness A “timeless” approach can quickly become “characterless”. It is therefore all the more important that the product stands for itself and not for fleeting trends that roll up like tidal waves on the beach of fashion. That’s why I decided in favour of a simple but striking, function-reflecting aesthetic. This defined design language is also intended to flatteringly emphasise the wearer’s facial features. This approach, together with the detachable microphone, is intended to make the headphones universal and attractive to a broad target group.","title":"Modular headphones"},{"categories":null,"date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"Spare-time project: Digital Mockups - Portfolio-Snippet (2023)","keywords":null,"link":"/en/portfolio/snippet-02/","tags":null,"text":" Matrix tail light The goal was to design a customisable and animatable tail light that uses a series of presets to highlight different features of the vehicle. This can be realised using a multicolour LED matrix. The success of ideas in the concept phase depends heavily on convincing presentation. Therefore, this smaller demonstration project focuses interactive visualisation using DMU in the Godot 4 game engine. DMU creation procedure A mesh was modelled in Bender to present the rear light in the context of the vehicle geometry (Fig. 1). The light matrix geometry is controlled via its material groups and UV map using shaders to display various light pattern presets. Figure 2 shows the indicator shader, for example, which can play a wave-like animation using a simple sine function. A camera rig has been implemented for 3D navigation, which allows control similar to that in CAD software. Real-time lighting via HDRi has also been set to achieve adequate presentation (Fig. 3). Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Interactive, interesting, tangible. This type of presentation may be dismissed as a mere toy. Although this labelling is rather negative, it reveals the positive and desired effect: playfulness. Interactive media invites you to play and experiment. They are much more engaging than another series of bland words and images. Gamification is not a new concept, but it is often underutilised and not fully realised. If you want to stand out in the jungle of ideas, you need to communicate in a way that is not only understandable but also interesting.","title":"LED-Matrix DMU"},{"categories":null,"date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"Projekt “Being mobile without wheels” - Portfolio-Snippet (2023)","keywords":null,"link":"/en/portfolio/snippet-03/","tags":null,"text":" \"Being mobile without wheels\" (Semester 4) I have conclusively linked the project motto ‘being mobile without wheels’ with accessibility. The wheelchair has remained essentially unchanged for centuries. Stairs are often an almost insurmountable obstacle. With many wheelchairs, it is not possible to sit upright to prevent organ bruising. This project demonstrates how a ‘wheelchair without wheels’ could function plausibly and be integrated into everyday life in an ergonomic, aesthetic and acceptable way. Clarification of demand and user persona Painpoints Persona (fictional) On average, around 25% of every German city is not barrier-free. Local authorities are slow to adress architectural shortcomings. In my opinion, the core problem here is that it is tiring to have to rely on others to build or rebuild something barrier-free - a better solution would be mobility aids that can overcome the barriers. This is precisely the idea I am pursuing in this project. Standing up for your health Standing wheelchairs already offer health and social benefits and have had a significant influence on the new mobility aid concept. ● Study on user experiences: 93,3% felt happy when standing 80% felt more productive Source: Samson, D. et al. [online] (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35400287/) ● Publication on state of literature, esp. physical health: Improving bone health, reducing muscle tone, reducing pressure ulcers, promoting the vital capacity of the organs and many more positive effects Source: Dicianno, B. E. et al. publ. by Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America [online] (https://www.resna.org/Portals/0/Documents/Position%20Papers/RESNAStandingPositionPaper_Dec2013.pdf) Equipped for everyday life As the inflexible existing architecture is part of the initial problem, the new design must be created around it. Accordingly, the concept was developed in such a way that users as well as standing and wheelchair users have a common, convenient access area for handles and work surfaces. This challenge is resolved with ease and without compromise, thanks to the standing up feature. Technical framework In order to make the concept of a “walking chair” convincing, a technical framework was designed that takes static and kinematic aspects into account. In an analogy to human legs, driving links are labelled as muscles and static links as bones. A corresponding colour scheme made it easier to evaluate the mechanically moving system. The full technical development was far outside the scope of this semester project. However, the balancing using the hip mechanism proved to be promising in the mock-up and the projections regarding the required motor power are within a realisable range. Visual complexity vs. aesthetics In order to bring the complex blocked out model into a visually acceptable form, the shape was greatly simplified and functional segments were abstracted and segmented. The hip serves as the center, with a circular element providing an orientation reference for the eye. This approach ensures that the form remains comprehensible and readable. The design ultimately fades into the background and you can concentrate on the person rather than the machine. In this way, a new concept is perceived as less alienating and eventually becomes acceptable.","title":"Mobility aid eo"},{"categories":null,"date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"Projekt Gehäuse / Corporate Design - Portfolio-Snippet (2022)","keywords":null,"link":"/en/portfolio/snippet-04/","tags":null,"text":" Enclosure design (Semester 2) The task was to place a selected electrical appliance in a new enclosure with a completely new and rather inappropriate brand context. I opted for a bluetooth speaker with the brand design of NVIDIA, a company primarily known to consumers as a graphics card manufacturer. The shape as a unique selling proposition During the iterative sketching, process, a ‘fold-out’ form factor emerged, which allows the sound volume to be increased. Despite the interesting plaette of textures I prepared, the simply accentuated version resulted in the most harmonious overall picture, complementing the expandable form. Final enclosure The enclosure can be slid together for transport to protect the buttons and the I/O from dust and scratches. The sliding action at the start of use also creates a motor-cognitive association with the product. This way, the recognition value is not only of a visual nature. Manufacturing and assembly orientated design In addition to the aesthetic design, technical feasibility was also a focus during development. In order to realise volume changes with effective sealing, a valve (pictured right) was developed for underpressure and overpressure compensation. One of these is located on each of the two passive radiators. The picture on the left shows part of the functional model, which shows the simple assembly of the electronics on the unfolded centrepiece. When folded together, this design makes optimal use of the installation space.","title":"Bluetooth Box"}]
