> ##### Communication	
>*Self-reflection is crucial for understanding communication. <br> If you cannot see yourself and your work from a third-person perspective,  <br> you may become creatively stuck and limit your ability to engage in dialogue.*
><br>
><br>
> ##### Key competences	
> *Design X Technology: My aim is to act as a generalist in product development, <br> which is why I completely ignore the concept of "inside and outside the box". <br> For the best results, you ultimately have to keep an eye on all the competences of a project*
><br>*This holistic approach requires courage and a willingness to learn, <br> but it proves to be a recipe for success.*
