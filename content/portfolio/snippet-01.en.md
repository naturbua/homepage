<h4> Sustainability (Semester 3) </h4> </p>

My approach to sustainability involves making products more durable through foresight during development. Using the headset as an example, I focused on measures that make the product itself more robust and accessible for repairs and upgrades. The aesthetic design should consistently reflect authenticity, honesty, and functionality to avoid the constant changes in fashion.

<h4> Separable, honest, single-type. </h4> </p>

The design focussed on simple assembly, accessibility and separability of the components.
In order to achieve this without conflict, I decided to incorporate a technically more complex but rational solution at the points marked in red.
The sliding contact (next picture) offers an elegant interface that ensures easy separability and completely eliminates the risk of cable breaks at the yoke.

<h4> Separable sliding contact, 6-pin, approx. 20Â° inclinable </h4> </p>

Instead of running a often delicate cable through the yoke as it is common for this product segment, a separable sliding contact was introduced at the hinge points.
Although this is a technically more complex solution in terms of production, the advantage of simple assembly and disassembly in a durable product outweighs this. Any cost increases can be reduced by using the sliding contact multiple times in similar product series.
This solution is used on both joints of the yoke, the illustrations only show one position.

<h4> In pursuit of timelessness </h4> </p>

A "timeless" approach can quickly become "characterless".
It is therefore all the more important that the product stands for itself and not for fleeting trends that roll up like tidal waves on the beach of fashion.
That's why I decided in favour of a simple but striking, function-reflecting aesthetic.
This defined design language is also intended to flatteringly emphasise the wearer's facial features.
</p> This approach, together with the detachable microphone, is intended to make the headphones universal and attractive to a broad target group.
