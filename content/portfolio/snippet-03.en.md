<h4> "Being mobile without wheels" (Semester 4) </h4> </p>

I have conclusively linked the project motto ‘being mobile without wheels’ with accessibility. The wheelchair has remained essentially unchanged for centuries. Stairs are often an almost insurmountable obstacle. With many wheelchairs, it is not possible to sit upright to prevent organ bruising.
This project demonstrates how a ‘wheelchair without wheels’ could function plausibly and be integrated into everyday life in an ergonomic, aesthetic and acceptable way.

On average, around 25% of every German city is not barrier-free. Local authorities are slow to adress architectural shortcomings. In my opinion, the core problem here is that it is tiring to have to rely on others to build or rebuild something barrier-free - a better solution would be mobility aids that can overcome the barriers. This is precisely the idea I am pursuing in this project.

<h4> Standing up for your health </h4> </p>

Standing wheelchairs already offer health and social benefits and have had a significant influence on the new mobility aid concept.

● Study on user experiences:<br>
93,3% felt happy when standing <br>
80% felt more productive

<h4> Equipped for everyday life </h4> </p>

As the inflexible existing architecture is part of the initial problem, the new design must be created around it.  <br><br>
Accordingly, the concept was developed in such a way that users as well as standing and wheelchair users have a common, convenient access area for handles and work surfaces.
This challenge is resolved with ease and without compromise, thanks to the standing up feature.

<h4> Technical framework</h4> </p>

In order to make the concept of a "walking chair" convincing, a technical framework was designed that takes static and kinematic aspects into account. In an analogy to human legs, driving links are labelled as muscles and static links as bones. A corresponding colour scheme made it easier to evaluate the mechanically moving system. <br> <br>
The full technical development was far outside the scope of this semester project. However, the balancing using the hip mechanism proved to be promising in the mock-up and the projections regarding the required motor power are within a realisable range.

<h4> Visual complexity vs. aesthetics </h4> </p>

In order to bring the complex blocked out model into a visually acceptable form, the shape was greatly simplified and functional segments were abstracted and segmented.  The hip serves as the center, with a circular element providing an orientation reference for the eye. This approach ensures that the form remains comprehensible and readable. <br><br>
The design ultimately fades into the background and you can concentrate on the person rather than the machine. In this way, a new concept is perceived as less alienating and eventually becomes acceptable.
