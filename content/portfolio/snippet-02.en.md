<h4> Matrix tail light </h4> </p>

The goal was to design a customisable and animatable tail light that uses a series of presets to highlight different features of the vehicle. This can be realised using a multicolour LED matrix.
The success of ideas in the concept phase depends heavily on convincing presentation. <br> Therefore, this smaller demonstration project focuses interactive visualisation using DMU in the Godot 4 game engine.

<h4> DMU creation procedure </h4> </p>

A mesh was modelled in Bender to present the rear light in the context of the vehicle geometry (Fig. 1).
The light matrix geometry is controlled via its material groups and UV map using shaders to display various light pattern presets. Figure 2 shows the indicator shader, for example, which can play a wave-like animation using a simple sine function.
A camera rig has been implemented for 3D navigation, which allows control similar to that in CAD software. Real-time lighting via HDRi has also been set to achieve adequate presentation (Fig. 3).

<h4>Interactive, interesting, tangible. </h4> </p>


This type of presentation may be dismissed as a mere toy. Although this labelling is rather negative, it reveals the positive and desired effect: playfulness. Interactive media invites you to play and experiment. They are much more engaging than another series of bland words and images. Gamification is not a new concept, but it is often underutilised and not fully realised.  **If you want to stand out in the jungle of ideas, you need to communicate in a way that is not only understandable but also interesting.**
