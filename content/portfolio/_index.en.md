<h3> Modular headphones (2022) </h3> 

My approach to sustainability involves making products more durable through foresight during development. 
Using the headset as an example, I focused on measures that make the product itself more robust and accessible for repairs and upgrades.
The aesthetic design should consistently reflect authenticity, honesty, and functionality to avoid the constant changes in fashion.

<h3> LED-Matrix Digital Mockup (2023) </h3> 

The goal was to design a customisable and animatable tail light that uses a series of presets to highlight different features of the vehicle. This can be realised using a multicolour LED matrix.
The success of ideas in the concept phase depends heavily on convincing presentation. <br> Therefore, this smaller demonstration project focuses interactive visualisation using DMU in the Godot 4 game engine.

<h3> Mobility aid eo </h3> 

I have conclusively linked the project motto 'being mobile without wheels' with accessibility. The wheelchair has remained essentially unchanged for centuries. Stairs are often an almost insurmountable obstacle. With many wheelchairs, it is not possible to sit upright to prevent organ bruising. <br> This project demonstrates how a 'wheelchair without wheels' could function plausibly and be integrated into everyday life in an ergonomic, aesthetic and acceptable way.

<h3> Bluetooth Speaker / Corporate Design </h3>

The task was to place a selected electrical appliance in a new enclosure with a completely new and rather inappropriate brand context.
I opted for a bluetooth speaker with the brand design of NVIDIA, a company primarily known to consumers as a graphics card manufacturer.
Inspired by the company's innovative strength, I also gave the Bluetooth box an USP.
