<h3> Modular headphones (2022) </h3> 

My approach to sustainability involves making products more durable through foresight during development. <br><br>
Using the headset as an example, I focused on measures that make the product itself more robust and accessible for repairs and upgrades.
The aesthetic design should consistently reflect authenticity, honesty, and functionality to avoid the constant changes in fashion.

<h3> LED-Matrix Digital Mockup (2023) </h3> 

In order to illustrate the concept of an animatable matrix LED rear light, a DMU was created using a game engine.<br><br>

This allows real-time presentation of different configurations of the LED matrix, which can be freely combined via a user interface.

<h3> Mobility aid "eo" </h3> 

I have conclusively linked the framework theme of “being mobile without wheels” with accessibility. <br><br> The wheelchair has remained essentially unchanged for centuries. Stairs are often an insurmountable obstacle. Many models cannot be raised to prevent organ crushing. In this project, I show how a “wheelchair without wheels” can function plausibly and be integrated sensibly into everyday life with existing infrastructure and architecture from an ergonomic and aesthetic point of view.

<h3> Bluetooth Speaker / Corporate Design </h3>

The task was to place a selected electrical appliance in a new enclosure with a completely new and rather inappropriate brand context.<br><br>
I opted for a bluetooth box with the brand design of NVIDIA, which was (at the time) primarily known as a graphics card manufacturer. Inspired by the company's innovative strength, I also gave the Bluetooth box a USP: The speaker can be folded up to protect the interface and save space, while in the unfolded state it allows a larger sound volume and thus greater music enjoyment.

<h3> Interactive art installation - "Your Monument" (2024) </h3>

The task was to design a unique, interactive monument for <em>Quartier G - Old Foundry</em>. Quartier G comprises the campus area of the Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt and surrounding cultural and educational institutions. <br><br> The first challenge was to create a concept that expresses identification with the location. The final concept allows users to create a depth image of their face via a stereo camera, which is “modeled” as a monument in their image via a 6.2 x 4.2 m slider matrix
<br><br>
The second challenge was a mechanism that enables the 1536 sliders to be controlled. A device with 32 couplings means that only 128 actuators are required. The restriction that only one row can be moved at a time fits in with the planned homage to the casting process.
