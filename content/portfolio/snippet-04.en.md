<h4> Enclosure design (Semester 2) </h4> </p>

The task was to place a selected electrical appliance in a new enclosure with a completely new and rather inappropriate brand context.
I opted for a bluetooth speaker with the brand design of NVIDIA, a company primarily known to consumers as a graphics card manufacturer.

<h4> The shape as a unique selling proposition </h4> </p>

During the iterative sketching, process, a 'fold-out' form factor emerged, which allows the sound volume to be increased. Despite the interesting plaette of textures I prepared, the simply accentuated version resulted in the most harmonious overall picture, complementing the expandable form.

<h4> Final enclosure </h4> </p>

The enclosure can be slid together for transport to protect the buttons and the I/O from dust and scratches. <br>
The sliding action at the start of use also creates a motor-cognitive association with the product. This way, the recognition value is not only of a visual nature.

<h4> Manufacturing and assembly orientated design </h4> </p>
In addition to the aesthetic design, technical feasibility was also a focus during development.
In order to realise volume changes with effective sealing, a valve (pictured right) was developed for underpressure and overpressure compensation. One of these is located on each of the two passive radiators.<br>
The picture on the left shows part of the functional model, which shows the simple assembly of the electronics on the unfolded centrepiece. When folded together, this design makes optimal  use of the installation space.
